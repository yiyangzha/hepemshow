 *
 * @brief A collection of data that are recorded during the simulation.
 *
 * The following data is recorded during the simulation (mean is per event):
 *  - mean values in the individual layers of the calorimeter for energy deposit,
 *    neutral (gamma) and charged (electron/positron) particle simulation steps
 *  - mean number of energy deposited in the `absorber` and `gap`
 *  - mean number of secondary gamma, electron and positrons produced
 *  - mean number of neutral (gamma) and charged (electron/positron)
 *
 * Quantities, recorded in the individual layers are stored in histograms and
 * written to files at the end of the simulation while the others are reported
 * in the screen. An example looks like
 * ```
 *       --- Results::WriteResults ----------------------------------
 *
 *       Absorber: mean Edep = 6722.95 [MeV] and  Std-dev = 309.636 [MeV]
 *       Gap     : mean Edep = 2571.75 [MeV] and  Std-dev = 118.507 [MeV]
 *
 *       Mean number of gamma       4457.043
 *       Mean number of e-          7957.899
 *       Mean number of e+          428.922
 *
 *       Mean number of e-/e+ steps 36097
 *       Mean number of gamma steps 40436.2
